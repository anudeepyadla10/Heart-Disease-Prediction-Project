# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
Problem Identification:

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with early detection being critical for effective treatment and prevention. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error, leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses. A more efficient, automated, and data-driven approach is needed to predict heart disease risk accurately.

Solution:

To address this issue, I implemented a machine learning-based solution to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. By using a variety of input features, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health metrics, the model classifies whether a patient has heart disease or not.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Achieved an Accuracy of 95% using the Random Forest algorithm.
